First release of the redesigned sheet.
  Notable changes:
  Core page has been revamped to match the 5e sheet (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SIz9DByDeZw/U6M51aKP-OI/AAAAAAAAAzM/OZ72wWzJMTA/s1600/sheet1.jpg)
  Header part of the sheet now includes information such as Character Name, Race, Class, Background, Level, Alignment, Vision, XP
  Skills have moved to the core sheet. The skill page has been removed.
  Skill proficiency automatically adds "Jack of All Trades" if you are unproficient and it is checked. There are 3 states now (Unproficient, Proficient, and Expertise) which are displayed with a more visible token (â€”, +, or ++). The full description can be seen when clicking the select box.
  Skill modifiers can be seen on hover.
  Initiative's modifier is hidden - it can be seen on hover. (Not satisfied with the positioning of this.
  Armor Class (AC) now calculates based on the greater of Unarmored AC and Armored AC.
  Optional Settings tab has been added with the following options:
      Death saves can be whispered to the DM
      Initiative can have a tiebreaker. This adds a modifier based on your initiative bonus. For instance rolling a 14 on a d20 with a initiative bonus of 3 would be 17.03.
